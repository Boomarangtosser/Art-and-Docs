# Welcome to My Creative Repository!
This repository is a curated collection of my art, creative workflows, and documentation on how I update and maintain outdated information. Here, you'll find a mix of personal projects, process breakdowns, and insights into my approach to refining and evolving my work over time.

This is intended to provide a written and more in-depth perspective compared to my [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Schizosticks). My goal is to make knowledge more accessible and to offer people the option to engage with information through reading, in addition to watching.
